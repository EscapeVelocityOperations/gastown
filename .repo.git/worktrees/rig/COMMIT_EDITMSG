feat: add .runtime/overlay/ support for polecat/crew worktrees

Add overlay directory support to automatically copy gitignored files
(like .env, config files) from <rig>/.runtime/overlay/ to polecat
and crew worktree roots when they are spawned.

This allows services started by polecats/crew to have their required
configuration files at the root without committing them to git.
